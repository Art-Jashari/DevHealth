//! System resource monitoring (planned feature)
//!
//! This module will provide functionality for monitoring system resources
//! and their impact on development productivity, including:
//!
//! - CPU usage and load averages
//! - Memory consumption and availability
//! - Disk space and I/O performance
//! - Network connectivity and bandwidth
//! - Development tool performance metrics

/// Monitors system resources and performance metrics
///
/// This is a placeholder function for future system monitoring functionality.
/// When implemented, it will analyze system resources to provide insights into:
/// - Current resource utilization
/// - Performance bottlenecks
/// - Resource recommendations for development
/// - System health warnings
///
/// # Note
///
/// This function is currently not implemented and serves as a placeholder
/// for future development.
///
/// # Examples
///
/// ```rust
/// use devhealth::scanner::system;
///
/// // Future usage (not yet implemented)
/// system::monitor_system();
/// ```
pub fn monitor_system() {
    println!("System monitoring not implemented yet!");
}

#[cfg(test)]
mod tests {
    use super::*;

    #[test]
    fn monitor_system_does_not_panic() {
        // Ensure the placeholder function can be called without issues
        monitor_system();
    }
}
