//! Dependency health scanner (planned feature)
//!
//! This module will provide functionality for analyzing and monitoring
//! project dependencies across various ecosystems including:
//!
//! - Rust (`Cargo.toml`)
//! - Node.js (`package.json`, `package-lock.json`)
//! - Python (`requirements.txt`, `Pipfile`, `pyproject.toml`)
//! - Go (`go.mod`)
//! - And more...

/// Scans project dependencies for health and security issues
///
/// This is a placeholder function for future dependency scanning functionality.
/// When implemented, it will analyze project dependency files to check for:
/// - Outdated dependencies
/// - Security vulnerabilities
/// - License compatibility issues
/// - Dependency conflicts
///
/// # Note
///
/// This function is currently not implemented and serves as a placeholder
/// for future development.
///
/// # Examples
///
/// ```rust
/// use devhealth::scanner::deps;
///
/// // Future usage (not yet implemented)
/// deps::scan_dependencies();
/// ```
pub fn scan_dependencies() {
    println!("Dependency scanning not implemented yet");
}

#[cfg(test)]
mod tests {
    use super::*;

    #[test]
    fn scan_dependencies_does_not_panic() {
        // Ensure the placeholder function can be called without issues
        scan_dependencies();
    }
}
