//! Project analytics and code quality metrics (planned feature)
//!
//! This module will provide functionality for analyzing project health
//! and code quality metrics, including:
//!
//! - Code complexity analysis
//! - Test coverage metrics
//! - Documentation coverage
//! - Technical debt indicators
//! - Code style and formatting consistency

/// Analyzes projects for code quality and health metrics
///
/// This is a placeholder function for future project analytics functionality.
/// When implemented, it will analyze codebases to provide insights into:
/// - Code quality metrics and trends
/// - Test coverage analysis
/// - Documentation completeness
/// - Technical debt assessment
/// - Best practice compliance
///
/// # Note
///
/// This function is currently not implemented and serves as a placeholder
/// for future development.
///
/// # Examples
///
/// ```rust
/// use devhealth::scanner::analytics;
///
/// // Future usage (not yet implemented)
/// analytics::analyze_projects();
/// ```
pub fn analyze_projects() {
    println!("Project analytics not implemented yet");
}

mod tests {
    use super::*;

    #[test]
    fn analyze_projects_does_not_panic() {
        // Ensure the placeholder function can be called without issues
        analyze_projects();
    }
